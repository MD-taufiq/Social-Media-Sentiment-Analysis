Social Media Sentiment Analysis
Internship Project â€“ Brainwavy Matrix Solutions
Author: Multani Mohammad Taufiq Firozkhan

Project Overview
This repository presents a sentiment analysis project developed during a data science internship at Brainwavy Matrix Solutions. The project involved analyzing synthetic social media data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify user sentiment and visualize results through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Objective
The goal of this project was to extract and analyze sentiment from social media posts, categorizing them into Positive, Neutral, or Negative using the VADER sentiment analysis model. The outcomes were visualized using Power BI to gain insights into public sentiment patterns and engagement behavior.

Tools and Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, VADER)
- Google Colab (Development Environment)
- Microsoft Power BI (Interactive Dashboard)
- Microsoft Word (Report Writing)

Dataset Description
The dataset comprises 2,000 synthetic social media posts with the following fields:
- Post Content
- Sentiment Label (predefined)
- Post Date and Time
- Number of Likes, Shares, and Comments
- Post Type (text, image, video)
- Language

Methodology

1. Data Cleaning
   - Converted text to lowercase
   - Removed URLs, punctuation, and special characters
   - Eliminated stopwords for improved analysis

2. Sentiment Analysis
   - Applied VADER sentiment analyzer to the cleaned text
   - Generated compound sentiment scores
   - Classified posts into Positive, Neutral, and Negative

3. Visualization
   - Visualized sentiment distribution using matplotlib in Python
   - Created an interactive Power BI dashboard for analysis

Power BI Dashboard Features
- KPI cards for total posts, likes, shares, and comments
- Bar chart showing sentiment distribution
- Line chart showing sentiment trend over time
- Pie chart visualizing post type distribution
- Table of top posts based on engagement
- Slicers to filter by sentiment, post type, and date range
